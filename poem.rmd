Alone I stand, in shadows deep,
Where echoes haunt, and memories sleep.
Solitude wraps its silent cloak,
In whispered sighs, my heart's bespoke.

Each step I take, a lonely road,
In search of solace, yet untold.
Stars above, my only guide,
In this vast expanse, where I abide.

But in this quiet, I find my voice,
A melody born of solitude's choice.
For in the lonesome, truth is found,
In depths of silence, beauty profound.
